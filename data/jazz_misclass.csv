171,Uncompromisingly Chill Some of you are probably familiar with the experience of needing to hear a very particular kind of music and you can almost hear it somewhere in your head or maybe your chest filtering faintly through the curtain of physical reality from some place of unadulterated incorporeal grace it's music that feels so archetypal that you are sure others hear it too most likely even musicians Yes there is no doubt music that affects a similar mood has certainly been recorded and is being listened to by people a little more fortunate than you This is a call to those more fortunate than I who know where to look when they crave a certain sound The craving this time is for something as the title suggests uncompromisingly sultry and chill Something like Russian Dolls or Lines by The Hics or something like Prungen by Jaga Jazzist minus all the abrasive noise that comprises the bulk of the middle section Something so sensuous that it could almost be mistaken for being evil if it weren't so clearly from a heavenly place Music that follows that path of least resistance in the vein of ambience while remaining complex enough to be engaging when you want it to be I'm looking for the most relaxing music you know in exotic keys An oasis in the desert Music that sounds the way good incense smells Animal furs and raw silks Delicate slow tempos deep rounded bass breathy flutes complex but smooth string melodies heavy middle eastern vibes but not in a classical sense Music you could use as a backdrop to prayer as quickly as you could to seduce a lover I'm definitely not looking for your run of the mill world music Nothing that smells too much like patchouli or sounds like it could be found in a coffee shop mixtape I'm looking for something grand but artfully subdued something clearly modern and progressive but with undertones of something as old as sin Earthy and warm but ethereal Visceral and soulful Maybe even music that's capable of bringing the right person to tears I know it's almost self defeating in its degree of specification but I also know there must be music like this out there somewhere Anything that could lead me to something that even nearly fits the description above would be appreciated Appreciated is an understatement This is a very deep craving of mine There is a hole in my existence shaped roughly like what I just described This is something I've been searching for for quite a while and I've hardly had a glimpse of it yet I'm looking for nourishment Musical mana Much needed soul food So please let's open a discussion,0,classicalmusic,jazz,False
